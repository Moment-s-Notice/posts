## A Heading
It's raining today, today being mid-January. The sun has already sunk below the horizon taking with it the little light that had managed to diffuse through the clouds. It isn’t the kind of weather (the rain, that is) that would be expected in a region known for reportedly relentless winters. It's slightly disorienting. But looking at the forecast, the temperature drops into the negatives next week. Cold weather advisories go out to warn of the approaching winter storm, and miserably frozen, all will be right in the Midwest.

There is a certain brutality associated with being layered head to toe, cold nonetheless crawling into your soul as you walk as briskly as possible between points A and B. But there is a novel set of emotions that comes with trudging through dirty slush and puddles in the heart of winter. Whereas reaching the refuge of the indoors would have brought an immediate relief from the vicious cold, life itself reentering circulation as you cross a vestibule, now standing wet–shoes damp, legs not covered by an umbrella (that, honestly, never stood a chance against the adversarial winds that grace this town)–the affection of the glum weather clings to you and drags itself in. But beyond the direct experiential differences, there is also an underlying sense of impending doom that embeds itself deep in the mind. Only a couple years ago, the same negative temperatures would not be a cold weather warning. Rather, it would be a Tuesday. A Tuesday that might have saltier roads and might, if conversation got particularly slow, have warranted a passing comment among friends and colleagues.

That the mundane has become exceptional is, quite unfortunately, increasingly mundane. But all this being said, it isn’t difficult to imagine a world where winters are still cold. After all, climate catastrophe is a crisis of our own design. So why is it that our world seems to do everything it can to escape self-preservation?

Perhaps unsatisfyingly, climate crisis may simply be the natural tendency of human development. We would like to envision a reality where a person can shape the world around them. We develop myths of figures charting the very course of history. Indeed it is an undoubtedly romantic concept, but if anything, progress on the human scale is emergent. Quantum phenomena dissolving into noise, it is hard to assert that any great individuals are but conjurings of our collective dreams of exceptionalism: if there were no such giant known as Isaac Newton, any other name would fit just as well in his place. And so we uncover the crux of the matter. Change is not guided, cannot be guided. It is instead an artifact that arises from the chaos of human activity leaving us sailing on a ship we cannot steer. And so condemned to the tendencies of the ocean currents, we drift toward summers that set fire and winters that bring rain. And what does that leave us to do on this January night but buy rain boots.
